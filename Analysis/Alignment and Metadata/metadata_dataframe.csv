1A2B,HUMAN RHOA COMPLEXED WITH GTP ANALOGUE,,Homo sapiens,9606,"The 2.4-A resolution crystal structure of a dominantly active form of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, RhoAV14, complexed with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS), reveals a fold similar to RhoA-GDP, which has been recently reported (Wei, Y., Zhang, Y., Derewenda, U., Liu, X., Minor, W., Nakamoto, R. K., Somlyo, A. V., Somlyo, A. P., and Derewenda, Z. S. (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 4, 699-703), but shows large conformational differences localized in switch I and switch II. These changes produce hydrophobic patches on the molecular surface of switch I, which has been suggested to be involved in its effector binding. Compared with H-Ras and other GTPases bound to GTP or GTP analogues, the significant conformational differences are located in regions involving switches I and II and part of the antiparallel beta-sheet between switches I and II. Key residues that produce these conformational differences were identified. In addition to these differences, RhoA contains four insertion or deletion sites with an extra helical subdomain that seems to be characteristic of members of the Rho family, including Rac1, but with several variations in details. These sites also display large displacements from those of H-Ras. The ADP-ribosylation residue, Asn41, by C3-like exoenzymes stacks on the indole ring of Trp58 with a hydrogen bond to the main chain of Glu40. The recognition of the guanosine moiety of GTPgammaS by the GTPase contains water-mediated hydrogen bonds, which seem to be common in the Rho family. These structural differences provide an insight into specific interaction sites with the effectors, as well as with modulators such as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI).",x-ray diffraction,2.4,1,1,A,94.17989417989418%,31.818181818181817%,1488,218,2,2,"['MG', 'GSP']","MG, GSP","MAGNESIUM ION, 5'-GUANOSINE-DIPHOSPHATE-MONOTHIOPHOSPHATE",inactive,38,9,12,5,6,8,16,5,14,13,17,10,5,6,2,7,15,11,10,5,2

The backbone amide resonances of amino acid residues 10-13, 21, 31-39, 57-64, and 71 of Ras(1-171).GMPPNP, but not those of Ras(1-171).GDP, were extremely broadened, whereas other residues of Ras(1-171).GMPPNP exhibited amide resonances nearly as sharp as those of Ras(1-171). GDP. The residues exhibiting the extreme broadening, except for residues 21 and 71, are localized in three functional loop regions [loops L1, L2 (switch I), and L4 (switch II)], which are involved in hydrolysis of GTP and interactions with other proteins. From the temperature and magnetic field strength dependencies of the backbone amide resonance intensities, the extreme broadening was ascribed to the exchange at an intermediate rate on the NMR time scale. It was shown that the Ras(1-171) protein bound with GTP or GTPgammaS (another slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP) exhibits the same type of broadening. Therefore, it is a characteristic feature of the GTP-bound form of Ras that the L1, L2, and L4 loop regions, but not other regions, are in a rather slow interconversion between two or more stable conformers. This phenomenon, termed a ""regional polysterism"", of these loop regions may be related with their multifunctionality: the GTP-dependent interactions with several downstream target groups such as the Raf and RalGDS families and also with the GTPase activating protein (GAP) family. In fact, the binding of Ras(1-171).GMPPNP with the Ras-binding domain (residues 51-131) of c-Raf-1 was shown to eliminate the regional polysterism nearly completely. It was indicated, therefore, that each target/regulator selects its appropriate conformer among those presented by the ""polysteric"" binding interface of Ras. As the downstream target groups exhibit no apparent sequence homology to each other, it is possible that one target group prefers a conformer different from that preferred by another group. The involvement of loop L1 in the regional polysterism might suggest that the negative regulators, GAPs, bind to the polysteric binding interface (loops L2 and L4) of Ras and cooperatively select a conformer suitable for transition of the GTPase catalytic center, involving loops L1 and L4, into the highly active state.",solution nmr,,1,1,A,90.47619047619048%,100.0%,2766,173,2,2,"['MG', 'GDP']","MG, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,0,11,11,4,8,11,13,9,10,13,15,11,11,4,3,5,14,3,12,3,

They correspond to the most frequent oncogenic and the only nononcogenic mutation of Gly-12, respectively. The G12D mutation is the only mutant analyzed so far that crystallizes in a space group different from wild type, and the atomic model of the protein shows the most drastic changes of structure around the active site as compared to wild-type p21. This is due to the interactions of the aspartic acid side chain with Tyr-32, Gln-61, and the gamma-phosphate, which result in reduced mobility of these structural elements. The interaction between the carboxylate group of Asp-12 and the gamma-phosphate is mediated by a shared proton, which we show by 31P NMR measurements to exist in solution as well. The structure of p21 (G12P) is remarkably similar to that of wild-type p21 in the active site, including the position of the nucleophilic water.

Here we show that Arfaptin binds specifically to GTP-bound Arf1 and Arf6, but binds to Rac.GTP and Rac.GDP with similar affinities. The X-ray structure of Arfaptin reveals an elongated, crescent-shaped dimer of three-helix coiled-coils. Structures of Arfaptin with Rac bound to either GDP or the slowly hydrolysable analogue GMPPNP show that the switch regions adopt similar conformations in both complexes. Our data highlight fundamental differences between the molecular mechanisms of Rho and Ras family signalling, and suggest a model of Arfaptin-mediated synergy between the Arf and Rho family signalling pathways.",x-ray diffraction,2.6,1,3,D,93.65079365079364%,30.89887640449438%,1443,209,2,2,"['MG', 'GNP']","MG, GNP","MAGNESIUM ION, PHOSPHOAMINOPHOSPHONIC ACID-GUANYLATE ESTER",active,30,11,13,2,7,13,9,8,13,19,16,10,4,6,2,6,12,11,7,6,2

The Rap2A-GTP complex is the first structure of a small G protein with its natural ligand GTP. It shows that the hydroxyl group of Tyr32 forms a hydrogen bond with the gamma-phosphate of GTP and with Gly13. This interaction does not exist in the Rap2A-GTPgammaS complex. Tyr32 is conserved in many small G proteins, which probably also form this hydrogen bond with GTP. In addition, Tyr32 is structurally equivalent to a conserved arginine that binds GTP in trimeric G proteins. The actual participation of Tyr32 in GTP hydrolysis is not yet clear, but several possible roles are discussed. The conformational changes between the GDP and GTP complexes are located essentially in the switch I and II regions as described for the related oncoprotein H-Ras. However, the mobile segments vary in length and in the amplitude of movement. This suggests that even though similar regions might be involved in the GDP-GTP cycle of small G proteins, the details of the changes will be different for each G protein and will ensure the specificity of its interaction with a given set of cellular proteins.",x-ray diffraction,1.7,1,1,A,88.35978835978835%,49.390243902439025%,1429,240,3,3,"['MG', 'GDP']","MG, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,70,11,8,6,14,8,17,7,11,11,18,11,8,4,,8,9,5,9,1,1

In particular, two such mutants, Gly14-->Val (G14V) and Gln63-->Leu (Q63L), are often used interchangeably for such studies. However, while their in vitro rates of GTP hydrolysis are very similar, differences are observed in their other functional properties. The structure of G14V-RhoA is known; in order to assess whether structural variations are responsible for functional differences, the crystal structure of a Q63L-RhoA bound to the GTP-analog 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMPPNP) was determined at 1.5 A resolution. Overall, the structure is very similar to that of G14V-RhoA, but the significantly higher resolution data permit an improved basis for structural analysis and comparison.

1LF0,Crystal Structure of RasA59G in the GTP-bound form,,Homo sapiens,9606,"The conformational changes in Ras that accompany the hydrolysis of GTP are critical to its function as a molecular switch in signaling pathways. Understanding how GTP is hydrolyzed by revealing the sequence of intermediary structures in the reaction is essential for understanding Ras signaling. Until now, no structure of an intermediate in GTP hydrolysis has been experimentally determined for Ras alone. We have solved the crystal structure of the Ala-59 to Gly mutant of Ras, (RasA59G), bound to guanosine 5'-imidotriphosphate or GDP to 1.7-A resolution. In the guanosine 5'-imidotriphosphate-bound form, this mutant adopts a conformation that is intermediate between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of wild-type Ras and that is similar to what has been predicted by molecular dynamics simulation [Ma, J. P. & Karplus, M. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 11905-11910]. This conformation is stabilized by direct and water-mediated interactions between the switch 1 and switch 2 regions and is characterized by an increase in the binding affinity for GTP.

Their rate of hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by virtue of their intrinsic GTPase activity is slow, but can be accelerated by up to 10(5)-fold through interaction with rhoGAP, a GTPase-activating protein that stimulates Rho-family proteins. As such, rhoGAP plays a crucial role in regulating Rho-mediated signalling pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of RhoA and rhoGAP complexed with the transition-state analogue GDP.AlF4- at 1.65 A resolution. There is a rotation of 20 degrees between the Rho and rhoGAP proteins in this complex when compared with the ground-state complex Cdc42Hs.GMPPNP/rhoGAP, in which Cdc42Hs is bound to the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPNP. Consequently, in the transition state complex but not in the ground state, the rhoGAP domain contributes a residue, Arg85(GAP) directly into the active site of the G protein. We propose that this residue acts to stabilize the transition state of the GTPase reaction. RhoGAP also appears to function by stabilizing several regions of RhoA that are important in signalling the hydrolysis of GTP.",x-ray diffraction,1.65,1,2,B,77.24867724867724%,32.55813953488372%,1636,401,3,3,"['MG', 'ALF', 'GDP']","MG, ALF, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, TETRAFLUOROALUMINATE ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,224,10,12,5,6,8,15,5,14,13,15,10,4,7,2,6,15,10,10,5,2

Here we report the crystal structure of the complex between the Ral-binding domain of Sec5 and RalA bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GppNHp) at 2.1 A resolution, providing the first structural insights into the mechanism and specificity of sec6/8 regulation. The Sec5 Ral-binding domain folds into an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich structure, which represents a novel fold for an effector of a GTP-binding protein. The interface between the two proteins involves a continuous antiparallel beta-sheet, similar to that found in other effector/G-protein complexes, such as Ras and Rap1A.

Rab9 mediates late endosome to trans-Golgi transport and has recently been found to be a key cellular component for human immunodeficiency virus-1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles virus replication, suggesting that it may be a novel target in the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs. As part of our structure-based drug design program, we have determined the crystal structure of a C-terminally truncated human Rab9 (residues 1-177) to 1.25-A resolution. The overall structure shows a characteristic nucleotide binding fold consisting of a six-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by five alpha-helices with a tightly bound GDP molecule in the active site. Structure-based sequence alignment of Rab9 with other Rab proteins reveals that its active site consists of residues highly conserved in the Rab GTPase family, implying a common catalytic mechanism. However, Rab9 contains seven regions that are significantly different in conformation from other Rab proteins. Some of those regions coincide with putative effector-binding sites and switch I and switch II regions identified by structure/sequence alignments.

1X1R,Crystal structure of M-Ras in complex with GDP,Ras-related protein M-Ras,Mus musculus,10090,"Although some members of Ras family small GTPases, including M-Ras, share the primary structure of their effector regions with Ras, they exhibit vastly different binding properties to Ras effectors such as c-Raf-1. We have solved the crystal structure of M-Ras in the GDP-bound and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-bound forms. The overall structure of M-Ras resembles those of H-Ras and Rap2A, except that M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p exhibits a distinctive switch I conformation, which is caused by impaired intramolecular interactions between Thr-45 (corresponding to Thr-35 of H-Ras) of the effector region and the gamma-phosphate of Gpp(NH)p. Previous 31P NMR studies showed that H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p exists in two interconverting conformations, states 1 and 2. Whereas state 2 is a predominant form of H-Ras and corresponds to the ""on"" conformation found in the complex with effectors, state 1 is thought to represent the ""off"" conformation, whose tertiary structure remains unknown. 31P NMR analysis shows that free M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p predominantly assumes the state 1 conformation, which undergoes conformational transition to state 2 upon association with c-Raf-1. These results indicate that the solved structure of M-Ras-Gp-p(NH)p corresponds to the state 1 conformation. The predominance of state 1 in M-Ras is likely to account for its weak binding ability to the Ras effectors, suggesting the importance of the tertiary structure factor in small GTPase-effector interaction. Further, the first determination of the state 1 structure provides a molecular basis for developing novel anti-cancer drugs as compounds that hold Ras in the state 1 ""off"" conformation.",x-ray diffraction,1.3,1,1,A,89.41798941798942%,56.886227544910184%,1644,409,2,2,"['MG', 'GDP']","MG, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,238,8,8,5,7,11,9,7,12,14,16,11,9,5,5,9,16,7,9,,1
1XTQ,Structure of small GTPase human Rheb in complex with GDP,GTP-binding protein Rheb,Homo sapiens,9606,"The small GTPase Rheb displays unique biological and biochemical properties different from other small GTPases and functions as an important mediator between the tumor suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 and the mammalian target of rapamycin to stimulate cell growth. We report here the three-dimensional structures of human Rheb in complexes with GDP, GTP, and GppNHp (5'-(beta,gamma-imide)triphosphate), which reveal novel structural features of Rheb and provide a molecular basis for its distinct properties. During GTP/GDP cycling, switch I of Rheb undergoes conformational change while switch II maintains a stable, unusually extended conformation, which is substantially different from the alpha-helical conformation seen in other small GTPases. The unique switch II conformation results in a displacement of Gln64 (equivalent to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras), making it incapable of participating in GTP hydrolysis and thus accounting for the low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. This rearrangement also creates space to accommodate the side chain of Arg15, avoiding its steric hindrance with the catalytic residue and explaining its noninvolvement in GTP hydrolysis. Unlike Ras, the phosphate moiety of GTP in Rheb is shielded by the conserved Tyr35 of switch I, leading to the closure of the GTP-binding site, which appears to prohibit the insertion of a potential arginine finger from its GTPase-activating protein. Taking the genetic, biochemical, biological, and structural data together, we propose that Rheb forms a new group of the Ras/Rap subfamily and uses a novel GTP hydrolysis mechanism that utilizes Asn1643 of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 GTPase-activating protein domain instead of Gln64 of Rheb as the catalytic residue.",x-ray diffraction,2.0,1,1,A,89.41798941798942%,36.477987421383645%,1537,335,2,2,"['MG', 'GDP']","MG, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,164,10,9,3,15,9,14,8,13,14,15,17,9,6,3,7,8,3,5,,1

The Rab11 subfamily members, comprising Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25, act in recycling of proteins from the endosomes to the plasma membrane, in transport of molecules from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and in phagocytosis. In this work, we describe Rab11b-GDP and Rab11b-GppNHp crystal structures solved to 1.55 and 1.95 angstroms resolution, respectively. Although Rab11b shares 90% amino acid identity to Rab11a, its crystal structure shows critical differences relative to previously reported Rab11a structures. Inactive Rab11a formed dimers with unusually ordered Switch regions and missing the magnesium ion at the nucleotide binding site. In this work, inactive Rab11b crystallized as a monomer showing a flexible Switch I and a magnesium ion which is coordinated by four water molecules, the phosphate beta of GDP (beta-P) and the invariant S25. S20 from the P-loop and S42 from the Switch I are associated to GTP hydrolysis rate. In the active structures, S20 interacts with the gamma-P oxygen in Rab11b-GppNHp but does not in Rab11a-GppNHp and the Q70 side chain is found in different positions. In the Rab11a-GTPgammaS structure, S40 is closer to S25 and S42 does not interact with the gamma-P oxygen. These differences indicate that the Rab11 isoforms may possess different GTP hydrolysis rates. In addition, the Switch II of inactive Rab11b presents a 3(10)-helix (residues 69-73) that disappears upon activation. This 3(10)-helix is not found in the Rab11a-GDP structure, which possesses a longer alpha2 helix, spanning from residue 73 to 82 alpha-helix 5.",x-ray diffraction,1.55,1,1,A,74.60317460317461%,35.80246913580247%,1555,360,2,2,"['MG', 'GDP']","MG, GDP","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,185,9,15,2,12,11,12,8,10,16,13,14,5,10,3,7,10,1,13,,2

We present the crystal structure of the GTPase Rac1 bound to phospholipase C-beta2 (PLC-beta2), a classic effector of heterotrimeric G proteins. Rac1 engages the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of PLC-beta2 to optimize its orientation for substrate membranes. Gbetagamma also engages the PH domain to activate PLC-beta2, and these two activation events are compatible, leading to additive stimulation of phospholipase activity. In contrast to PLC-delta, the PH domain of PLC-beta2 cannot bind phosphoinositides, eliminating this mode of regulation. The structure of the Rac1-PLC-beta2 complex reveals determinants that dictate selectivity of PLC-beta isozymes for Rac GTPases over other Rho-family GTPases, and substitutions within PLC-beta2 abrogate its stimulation by Rac1 but not by Gbetagamma, allowing for functional dissection of this integral signaling node.",x-ray diffraction,2.2,1,2,A,93.65079365079364%,32.58426966292135%,1488,251,2,2,"['MG', 'GSP']","MG, GSP, CA","MAGNESIUM ION, 5'-GUANOSINE-DIPHOSPHATE-MONOTHIOPHOSPHATE, CALCIUM ION",inactive,72,11,13,3,7,13,9,8,13,18,16,10,5,6,2,6,12,11,7,5,2

2GCN,Crystal structure of the human RhoC-GDP complex,Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoC,Homo sapiens,9606,"RhoC is a member of the Rho family of Ras-related (small) GTPases and shares significant sequence similarity with the founding member of the family, RhoA. However, despite their similarity, RhoA and RhoC exhibit different binding preferences for effector proteins and give rise to distinct cellular outcomes, with RhoC being directly implicated in the invasiveness of cancer cells and the development of metastasis. While the structural analyses of the signaling-active and -inactive states of RhoA have been performed, thus far, the work on RhoC has been limited to an X-ray structure for its complex with the effector protein, mDia1 (for mammalian Diaphanous 1). Therefore, in order to gain insights into the molecular basis for RhoC activation, as well as clues regarding how it mediates distinct cellular responses relative to those induced by RhoA, we have undertaken a structural comparison of RhoC in its GDP-bound (signaling-inactive) state versus its GTP-bound (signaling-active) state as induced by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-iminotriphosphate) (GppNHp) and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). Interestingly, we find that GppNHp-bound RhoC only shows differences in its switch II domain, relative to GDP-bound RhoC, whereas GTPgammaS-bound RhoC exhibits differences in both its switch I and switch II domains. Given that each of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues is able to promote the binding of RhoC to effector proteins, these results suggest that RhoC can undergo at least two conformational transitions during its conversion from a signaling-inactive to a signaling-active state, similar to what has recently been proposed for the H-Ras and M-Ras proteins. In contrast, the available X-ray structures for RhoA suggest that it undergoes only a single conformational transition to a signaling-active state. These and other differences regarding the changes in the switch domains accompanying the activation of RhoA and RhoC provide plausible explanations for the functional specificity exhibited by the two GTPases.",x-ray diffraction,1.85,1,1,A,93.65079365079364%,33.13953488372093%,1675,401,7,7,"['MG', 'EDO', 'GDP']","MG, GDP, EDO","MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE, 1,2-ETHANEDIOL",inactive,217,10,11,4,8,8,17,5,13,14,15,11,5,5,2,7,14,10,11,5,2

Here we solve the crystal structure of a YpkA-Rac1 complex and find that YpkA possesses a Rac1 binding domain that mimics host guanidine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) of the Rho GTPases. YpkA inhibits nucleotide exchange in Rac1 and RhoA, and mutations that disrupt the YpkA-GTPase interface abolish this activity in vitro and impair in vivo YpkA-induced cytoskeletal disruption. In cell culture experiments, the kinase and the GDI domains of YpkA act synergistically to promote cytoskeletal disruption, and a Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant lacking YpkA GDI activity shows attenuated virulence in a mouse infection assay.

A family of Rab11 interacting proteins (FIPs) that conserve a C-terminal Rab-binding domain (RBD) selectively recognize the active form of Rab11. Normal completion of cytokinesis requires a complex between Rab11 and FIP3. Here, we report the crystal structure and mutational analysis of a heterotetrameric complex between constitutively active Rab11 and a FIP3 construct that includes the RBD. Two Rab11 molecules bind to dyad symmetric sites at the C terminus of FIP3, which forms a non-canonical coiled-coiled dimer with a flared C terminus and hook region. The RBD overlaps with the coiled coil and extends through the C-terminal hook. Although FIP3 engages the switch and interswitch regions of Rab11, the mode of interaction differs significantly from that of other Rab-effector complexes. In particular, the switch II region undergoes a large structural rearrangement from an ordered but non-complementary active conformation to a remodeled conformation that facilitates the interaction with FIP3.

Here we describe the crystal structure of Ras in complex with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of NORE1A/RAPL. All Ras effectors share a common topology in their RBD creating an interface with the switch I region of Ras, whereas NORE1A/RAPL RBD reveals additional structural elements forming a unique Ras switch II binding site. Consequently, the contact area of NORE1A is extended as compared with other Ras effectors. We demonstrate that the enlarged interface provides a rationale for an exceptionally long lifetime of the complex.

They contain formin homology 1 (FH1) and 2 (FH2) domains as the catalytic machinery for the formation of linear actin cables. A subclass of formins constitutes the Diaphanous-related formins, members of which are regulated by the binding of a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho subfamily. Binding of these molecular switch proteins to the regulatory N-terminal mDia(N), including the GTPase-binding domain, leads to the release of auto-inhibition. From the three mDia isoforms, mDia1 is activated only by Rho (RhoA, -B, and -C), in contrast to mDia2 and -3, which is also activated by Rac and Cdc42. Little is known about the determinants of specificity. Here we report on the interactions of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 with mDia1 and an mDia1 mutant (mDia(N)-Thr-Ser-His (TSH)), which based on structural information should mimic mDia2 and -3. Specificity is analyzed by biochemical studies and a structural analysis of a complex between Cdc42.Gpp(NH)p and mDia(N)-TSH.

The triple N motif of mDia1 allows tight interaction with Rho because of the presence of Phe-106, whereas the corresponding His-104 in Rac and Cdc42 forms a complementary interface with the TSH motif in mDia2/3.

Missense mutations of the GTPase Rab7 cause a dominantly inherited axonal degeneration known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B through an unknown mechanism. We present the 2.8 A crystal structure of GTP-bound L129F mutant Rab7 which reveals normal conformations of the effector binding regions and catalytic site, but an alteration to the nucleotide binding pocket that is predicted to alter GTP binding. Through extensive biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that disease-associated mutations in Rab7 do not lead to an intrinsic GTPase defect, but permit unregulated nucleotide exchange leading to both excessive activation and hydrolysis-independent inactivation. Consistent with augmented activity, mutant Rab7 shows significantly enhanced interaction with a subset of effector proteins. In addition, dynamic imaging demonstrates that mutant Rab7 is abnormally retained on target membranes. However, we show that the increased activation of mutant Rab7 is counterbalanced by unregulated, GTP hydrolysis-independent membrane cycling. Notably, disease mutations are able to rescue the membrane cycling of a GTPase-deficient mutant. Thus, we demonstrate that disease mutations uncouple Rab7 from the spatial and temporal control normally imposed by regulatory proteins and cause disease not by a gain of novel toxic function, but by misregulation of native Rab7 activity.",x-ray diffraction,2.8,1,5,A,93.65079365079364%,30.303030303030305%,1460,189,2,2,"['MG', 'GNP']","MG, GNP","MAGNESIUM ION, PHOSPHOAMINOPHOSPHONIC ACID-GUANYLATE ESTER",active,10,8,15,3,8,12,11,5,13,13,16,9,11,11,,12,11,5,8,3,3

As many regulatory proteins are modular, considerable progress in engineering signaling circuits has been made by recombining commonly occurring domains.

Here we demonstrate a strategy for improving and simplifying protein network engineering: using computational design to create orthogonal (non-crossreacting) protein-protein interfaces. We validated the design of the interface between a key signaling protein, the GTPase Cdc42, and its activator, Intersectin, biochemically and by solving the crystal structure of the engineered complex. The designed GTPase (orthoCdc42) is activated exclusively by its engineered cognate partner (orthoIntersectin), but maintains the ability to interface with other GTPase signaling circuit components in vitro.

Here, we report the crystal structures of EhRho1 in both active and inactive states. EhRho1 is activated by a conserved switch mechanism, but diverges from mammalian Rho GTPases in lacking a signature Rho insert helix. EhRho1 engages a homolog of mDia, EhFormin1, suggesting a role in mediating serum-stimulated actin reorganization and microtubule formation during mitosis. EhRho1, but not a constitutively active mutant, interacts with a newly identified EhRhoGDI in a prenylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, constitutively active EhRho1 induces actin stress fiber formation in mammalian fibroblasts, thereby identifying it as a functional Rho family GTPase. EhRho1 exhibits a fast rate of nucleotide exchange relative to mammalian Rho GTPases due to a distinctive switch one isoleucine residue reminiscent of the constitutively active F28L mutation in human Cdc42, which for the latter protein, is sufficient for cellular transformation. Nonconserved, nucleotide-interacting residues within EhRho1, revealed by the crystal structure models, were observed to contribute a moderating influence on fast spontaneous nucleotide exchange.

Signaling through plexins has been proposed to rely on specific guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein (GAP) activity for R-Ras and M-Ras. Activation of this GAP activity of plexins appears to require simultaneous binding of semaphorin to the plexin extracellular domain and of the Rho GTPases Rac1 or Rnd1 to the cytoplasmic region. However, GAP activity of plexins has eluded detection in several recent studies. We show that the purified cytoplasmic region of plexin uses a noncanonical catalytic mechanism to act as a GAP for Rap, but not for R-Ras or M-Ras. The RapGAP activity of plexins was autoinhibited and was activated by induced dimerization. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses demonstrated that binding of Rho GTPases did not directly contribute to activation of plexin RapGAP activity. Semaphorin stimulated the RapGAP activity of full-length plexin in cells, which was required for plexin-mediated neuronal growth cone collapse.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that subtle regulation of the GTP-bound active state may occur through promotion of substates mediated by an allosteric switch mechanism that induces a disorder to order transition in switch II upon ligand binding at an allosteric site. We show with high-resolution structures that calcium acetate and either dithioerythritol (DTE) or dithiothreitol (DTT) soaked into H-Ras-GppNHp crystals in the presence of a moderate amount of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) can selectively shift the equilibrium to the ""on"" state, where the active site appears to be poised for catalysis (calcium acetate), or to what we call the ""ordered off"" state, which is associated with an anticatalytic conformation (DTE or DTT). We also show that the equilibrium is reversible in our crystals and dependent on the nature of the small molecule present. Calcium acetate binding in the allosteric site stabilizes the conformation observed in the H-Ras-GppNHp/NOR1A complex, and PEG, DTE, and DTT stabilize the anticatalytic conformation observed in the complex between the Ras homologue Ran and Importin-β. The small molecules are therefore selecting biologically relevant conformations in the crystal that are sampled by the disordered switch II in the uncomplexed GTP-bound form of H-Ras. In the presence of a large amount of PEG, the ordered off conformation predominates, whereas in solution, in the absence of PEG, switch regions appear to remain disordered in what we call the off state, unable to bind DTE.",x-ray diffraction,1.39,1,1,A,87.83068783068782%,99.3975903614458%,1526,345,6,6,"['CA', 'MG', 'DTU', 'GNP']","CA, MG, DTU, GNP","CALCIUM ION, MAGNESIUM ION, (2R,3S)-1,4-DIMERCAPTOBUTANE-2,3-DIOL, PHOSPHOAMINOPHOSPHONIC ACID-GUANYLATE ESTER",active,173,11,11,4,8,11,14,9,8,11,15,11,10,4,3,5,14,3,11,3,

They mediate spatial and temporal recruitment of effector proteins to distinct cellular compartments through GTP-induced changes in their conformation. Despite numerous structural studies, the molecular basis for Rab/effector specificity and subsequent biological activity remains poorly understood. Rab25, also known as Rab11c, which is epithelial-specific, has been heavily implicated in ovarian cancer development and independently appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the context of a distinct subset of carcinomas. Here, we show that Rab25 associates with FIP2 and can recruit this effector protein to endosomal membranes. We report the crystal structure of Rab25 in complex with the C-terminal region of FIP2, which consists of a central dimeric FIP2 coiled-coil that mediates a heterotetrameric Rab25-(FIP2)2-Rab25 complex. Thermodynamic analyses show that, despite a relatively conserved interface, FIP2 binds to Rab25 with an approximate 3-fold weaker affinity than to Rab11a. Reduced affinity is mainly associated with lower enthalpic gains for Rab25:FIP2 complex formation, and can be attributed to subtle differences in the conformations of switch 1 and switch 2.

Rab11 and Rab25 are closely related small GTPases that bind to common effectors termed the Rab11 family of interacting proteins (FIPs). The FIPs are organized into two subclasses (class I and class II) based on sequence and domain organization, and both subclasses contain a highly conserved Rab-binding domain at their C termini. Yeast two-hybrid and biochemical studies have revealed that the more distantly related Rab14 also interacts with class I FIPs. Here, we perform detailed structural, thermodynamic, and cellular analyses of the interactions between Rab14 and one of the class I FIPs, the Rab-coupling protein (RCP), to clarify the molecular aspects of the interaction. We find that Rab14 indeed binds to RCP, albeit with reduced affinity relative to conventional Rab11-FIP and Rab25-FIP complexes. However, in vivo, Rab11 recruits RCP onto biological membranes. Furthermore, biophysical analyses reveal a noncanonical 1:2 stoichiometry between Rab14-RCP in dilute solutions, in contrast to Rab11/25 complexes.

Several side chains are critical in determining specificity of this recognition, particularly the Lys31 residue in Rap1 that is oppositely charged compared with the Glu31/Asp31 residue in other Ras GTPases. Lys31 forms a salt bridge with RIAM residue Glu212, making it the key specificity determinant of the interaction. We also show that disruption of these interactions results in reduction of Rap1:RIAM association, leading to a loss of co-clustering and cell adhesion.

The Legionella pneumophila effector vacuolar protein sorting inhibitor protein D (VipD) localizes to early endosomal membranes and alters their lipid and protein composition, thereby protecting the pathogen from endosomal fusion. This process requires the phospholipase A1 (PLA1) activity of VipD that is triggered specifically on VipD binding to the host cell GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of endosomes. Here, we present the crystal structure of VipD in complex with constitutively active Rab5 and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying PLA1 activation. An active site-obstructing loop that originates from the C-terminal domain of VipD is repositioned on Rab5 binding, thereby exposing the catalytic pocket within the N-terminal PLA1 domain. Substitution of amino acid residues located within the VipD-Rab5 interface prevented Rab5 binding and PLA1 activation and caused a failure of VipD mutant proteins to target to Rab5-enriched endosomal structures within cells.

In rice, the Rac/Rop protein OsRac1 plays an important role in regulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB during innate immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which OsRac1 regulates OsRbohB remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of OsRac1 complexed with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate at 1.9 Å resolution; this represents the first active-form structure of a plant small GTPase. To elucidate the ROS production in rice cells, structural information was used to design OsRac1 mutants that displayed reduced binding to OsRbohB. Only mutations in the OsRac1 Switch I region showed attenuated interactions with OsRbohB in vitro. In particular, Tyr(39) and Asp(45) substitutions suppressed ROS production in rice cells, indicating that these residues are critical for interaction with and activation of OsRbohB. Structural comparison of active-form OsRac1 with AtRop9 in its GDP-bound inactive form showed a large conformational difference in the vicinity of these residues.

The RAS effector RAS- and RAB-interacting protein 1 (RIN1) activates its own downstream effectors, the small GTPase RAB5 and the tyrosine kinase Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL), to modulate endocytosis and cytoskeleton remodeling. To identify ABL substrates downstream of RAS-to-RIN1 signaling, we examined human HEK293T cells overexpressing components of this pathway. Proteomic analysis revealed several novel phosphotyrosine peptides, including Harvey rat sarcoma oncogene (HRAS)-pTyr(137). Here we report that ABL phosphorylates tyrosine 137 of H-, K-, and NRAS. Increased RIN1 levels enhanced HRAS-Tyr(137) phosphorylation by nearly 5-fold, suggesting that RAS-stimulated RIN1 can drive ABL-mediated RAS modification in a feedback circuit. Tyr(137) is well conserved among RAS orthologs and is part of a transprotein H-bond network.

The crystal structure of tyrosine-GlcNAcylated RhoA reveals an open conformation of the effector loop distinct from recently described structures of GDP- or GTP-bound RhoA.

This study is the first to thoroughly characterize a Rab effector protein that contains two separate Rab binding sites within a single domain, allowing Micals and EHBPs to bind two Rabs simultaneously, thus suggesting previously unknown functions of these effector molecules in endosomal trafficking.",x-ray diffraction,2.8,1,2,B,91.53439153439153%,35.02824858757062%,1409,176,2,2,"['MG', 'GNP']","MG, GNP","MAGNESIUM ION, PHOSPHOAMINOPHOSPHONIC ACID-GUANYLATE ESTER",active,1,10,13,4,11,17,10,9,15,15,11,13,6,7,1,7,13,1,7,1,2

Phosphodiesterase-δ (PDEδ) binds to KRAS4b and plays an important role in targeting it to cellular membranes. We solved structures of human farnesylated-methylated KRAS4b in complex with PDEδ in two different crystal forms. In these structures, the interaction is driven by the C-terminal amino acids together with the farnesylated and methylated C185 of KRAS4b that binds tightly in the central hydrophobic pocket present in PDEδ. In crystal form II, we see the full-length structure of farnesylated-methylated KRAS4b, including the hypervariable region. Crystal form I reveals structural details of farnesylated-methylated KRAS4b binding to PDEδ, and crystal form II suggests the potential binding mode of geranylgeranylated-methylated KRAS4b to PDEδ. We identified a 5-aa-long sequence motif (Lys-Ser-Lys-Thr-Lys) in KRAS4b that may enable PDEδ to bind both forms of prenylated KRAS4b. Structure and sequence analysis of various prenylated proteins that have been previously tested for binding to PDEδ provides a rationale for why some prenylated proteins, such as KRAS4a, RalA, RalB, and Rac1, do not bind to PDEδ. Comparison of all four available structures of PDEδ complexed with various prenylated proteins/peptides shows the presence of additional interactions due to a larger protein-protein interaction interface in KRAS4b-PDEδ complex.

Because of their very high sequence identity, biochemical studies done on H-Ras have been considered representative of all three Ras proteins. We show here that this is not a valid assumption. Using enzyme kinetic assays under identical conditions, we observed clear differences between the three isoforms in intrinsic catalysis of GTP by Ras in the absence and presence of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the c-Raf kinase protein (Raf-RBD).

The molecular processes controlling the endosomal positioning utilize several large protein complexes, one of which contains the small GTPase Rab7, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1 (ORP1L). Rab7 is known to interact with RILP through a canonical binding site termed the effector-interacting switch region, but it is not clear how Rab7 interacts with ORP1L, limiting our understanding of the overall process. Here, we report structural and biochemical investigation of the Rab7-ORP1L interaction. We found that, contrary to prior studies, the interaction between Rab7 and the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD<sub>N</sub>) of ORP1L is independent of Rab7's GTP- or GDP-binding state. Moreover, we show that Rab7 interacts with ORP1L ARD<sub>N</sub> via a unique region consisting of helix3 (α3) and 3<sub>10</sub>-helix 2 (η2). This architecture leaves the canonical effector-interacting switch regions available for RILP binding and thus allows formation of the ORP1L-Rab7-RILP tripartite complex.

Further, all patients with MLL-AF6 translocations express fusion proteins missing only this helix from AF6, resulting in exposure of hydrophobic residues that induce dimerization. We provide evidence that oligomerization is the dominant mechanism driving oncogenesis from rare MLL translocation partners and employ our mechanistic understanding of MLL-AF6 to examine how dimers induce leukemia. Proteomic data resolve association of dimerized MLL with gene expression modulators, and inhibiting dimerization disrupts formation of these complexes while completely abrogating leukemogenesis in mice.

Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that KRAS<sup>A146T</sup> exhibits a marked extension of switch 1 away from the protein body and nucleotide binding site, which activates KRAS by promoting a high rate of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide exchange factor-induced nucleotide exchange. Using mice genetically engineered to express either allele, we found that KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>A146T</sup> exhibit distinct tissue-specific effects on homeostasis that mirror mutational frequencies in human cancers.

6HUF,Coping with strong translational non-crystallographic symmetry and extreme anisotropy in molecular replacement with Phaser: human Rab27a,Ras-related protein Rab-27A,Homo sapiens,9606,"Data pathologies caused by effects such as diffraction anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry (tNCS) can dramatically complicate the solution of the crystal structures of macromolecules. Such problems were encountered in determining the structure of a mutant form of Rab27a, a member of the Rab GTPases. Mutant Rab27a constructs that crystallize in the free form were designed for use in the discovery of drugs to reduce primary tumour invasiveness and metastasis. One construct, hRab27a<sup>Mut</sup>, crystallized within 24 h and diffracted to 2.82 Å resolution, with a unit cell possessing room for a large number of protein copies. Initial efforts to solve the structure using molecular replacement by Phaser were not successful. Analysis of the data set revealed that the crystals suffered from both extreme anisotropy and strong tNCS. As a result, large numbers of reflections had estimated standard deviations that were much larger than their measured intensities and their expected intensities, revealing problems with the use of such data at the time in Phaser. By eliminating extremely weak reflections with the largest combined effects of anisotropy and tNCS, these problems could be avoided, allowing a molecular-replacement solution to be found. The lessons that were learned in solving this structure have guided improvements in the numerical analysis used in Phaser, particularly in identifying diffraction measurements that convey very little information content. The calculation of information content could also be applied as an alternative to ellipsoidal truncation. The post-mortem analysis also revealed an oversight in accounting for measurement errors in the fast rotation function.

Here, we established a cell-based screen to selectively degrade RHOB-GTP using F-box-intracellular single-domain antibody fusion. We identified one intracellular antibody (intrabody) that shows selective targeting of endogenous RHOB-GTP mediated by interactions between the CDR3 loop of the domain antibody and the GTP-binding pocket of RHOB.

ORP1 transports cholesterol at the interface between the late endosomes/lysosomes (LELs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ORP1 is targeted to the endosomal membranes by forming a tripartite complex with the LE GTPase Rab7 and its effector RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein). Here, we determined the crystal structure of human ORP1 ANK domain in complex with the GTP-bound form of Rab7. ORP1 ANK binds to the helix α3 of Rab7 located away from the switching regions, which makes the interaction independent of the nucleotide-binding state of Rab7. Thus, the effector-interacting switch regions of Rab7 are accessible for RILP binding, allowing formation of the ORP1-Rab7-RILP complex. ORP1 ANK binds to Rab7 and the Rab7-RILP complex with similar micro-molar affinities, which is consistent with the independence binding of ORP1 and RILP to Rab7.

Using a combined strategy, the novel inhibitor DC-Rhoin is discovered, which disrupts interaction of Rho proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Crystallographic studies reveal that the covalent binding of DC-Rhoin to the Cys107 residue stabilizes and captures a novel allosteric pocket. Moreover, the derivative compound DC-Rhoin04 inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells, through targeting this allosteric pocket of RhoA.

6MNX,Structural basis of impaired hydrolysis in KRAS Q61H mutant,GTPase KRas,Homo sapiens,9606,"Assembly of RAS molecules into complexes at the cell membrane is critical for RAS signaling. We previously showed that oncogenic KRAS codon 61 mutations increase its affinity for RAF, raising the possibility that KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup>, the most common KRAS mutation at codon 61, upregulates RAS signaling through mechanisms at the level of RAS assemblies. We show here that KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> exhibits preferential binding to RAF relative to PI3K in cells, leading to enhanced MAPK signaling in <i>in vitro</i> models and human NSCLC tumors. X-ray crystallography of KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup>:GTP revealed that a hyperdynamic switch 2 allows for a more stable interaction with switch 1, suggesting that enhanced RAF activity arises from a combination of absent intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity and increased affinity for RAF. Disruption of KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> assemblies by the RAS oligomer-disrupting D154Q mutation impaired RAF dimerization and altered MAPK signaling but had little effect on PI3K signaling. However, KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> oligomers but not KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> oligomers were disrupted by RAF mutations that disrupt RAF-RAF interactions. KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> cells show enhanced sensitivity to RAF and MEK inhibitors individually, whereas combined treatment elicited synergistic growth inhibition. Furthermore, KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> tumors in mice exhibited high vulnerability to MEK inhibitor, consistent with cooperativity between KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> and RAF oligomerization and dependence on MAPK signaling. These findings support the notion that KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> and functionally similar mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies against the MAPK pathway.

Here, we report a crystal structure of GDP-bound KRAS<sup>V14I</sup>, a mutated KRAS variant associated with the developmental RASopathy disorder Noonan syndrome (NS), at 1.5-1.6 Å resolution. The structure is notable for revealing a marked extension of switch 1 away from the G-domain and nucleotide-binding site of the KRAS protein. We found that this extension is associated with a loss of the magnesium ion and a tilt in the position of the guanine base because of the additional carbon introduced by the isoleucine substitution. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS analysis confirmed that this conformation occurs in solution, but also disclosed a difference in kinetics when compared with KRAS<sup>A146T</sup>, another RAS mutant that displays a nearly identical conformation in previously reported crystal structures.

These variants bound with high affinity with the effector-binding site of Ras in an active conformation. Structural characterization disclosed how the newly identified RBD mutations cooperate and thereby enhance affinity with the effector-binding site in Ras compared with WT RBD. The engineered RBD variants closely mimicked the interaction mode of naturally occurring Ras effectors and acted as dominant-negative affinity reagents that block Ras signal transduction. Experiments with cancer cells showed that expression of these RBD variants inhibits Ras signaling, reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Using these optimized RBD variants, we stratified patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with known Ras mutational status according to their response to Ras inhibition. These results revealed that the presence of Ras mutations was insufficient to predict sensitivity to Ras inhibition, suggesting that not all of these tumors required Ras signaling for proliferation.

Atg16L1 is an effector of the Golgi resident GTPase Rab33B. Here we identified a minimal stable complex of murine Rab33B(30-202) Q92L and Atg16L1(153-210). Atg16L1(153-210) comprises the C-terminal part of the Atg16L1 coiled-coil domain. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rab33B Q92L/Atg16L1(153-210) effector complex at 3.47 Å resolution. This structure reveals that two Rab33B molecules bind to the diverging α-helices of the dimeric Atg16L1 coiled-coil domain. We mutated Atg16L1 and Rab33B interface residues and found that they disrupt complex formation in pull-down assays and cellular co-localization studies. The Rab33B binding site of Atg16L1 comprises 20 residues and immediately precedes the WIPI2b binding site. Rab33B mutations that abolish Atg16L binding also abrogate Rab33B association with the Golgi stacks. Atg16L1 mutants that are defective in Rab33B binding still co-localize with WIPI2b in vivo.

6ZAY,Crystal structure of Atg16L in complex with GDP-bound Rab33B,,Homo sapiens,9606,"Autophagosome formation is a fundamental process in macroautophagy/autophagy, a conserved self-eating mechanism in all eukaryotes, which requires the conjugating ATG (autophagy related) protein complex, ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 and lipidated MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). How the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex is recruited to membranes is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that RAB33B plays a key role in recruiting the ATG16L1 complex to phagophores during starvation-induced autophagy. Crystal structures of RAB33B bound to the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of ATG16L1 revealed the recognition mechanism between RAB33B and ATG16L1. ATG16L1 is a novel RAB-binding protein (RBP) that can induce RAB proteins to adopt active conformation without nucleotide exchange. RAB33B and ATG16L1 mutually determined the localization of each other on phagophores. RAB33B-ATG16L1 interaction was required for LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation. Upon starvation, a fraction of RAB33B translocated from the Golgi to phagophores and recruited the ATG16L1 complex. In this work, we reported a new mechanism for the recruitment of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to phagophores by RAB33B, which is required for autophagosome formation.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related; Cα: alpha carbon; CCD: coiled-coil domain; CLEM: correlative light and electron microscopy; DTE: dithioerythritol; EBSS: Earle's balanced salt solution; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FLIM: fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FRET: Förster resonance energy transfer; GDP: guanosine diphosphate; GOLGA2/GM130: golgin A2; GppNHp: guanosine 5'-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate; GST: glutathione S-transferase; GTP: guanosine triphosphate; GTPγS: guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate; HA (tag): hemagglutinin (tag); HEK: human embryonic kidney; HeLa: Henrietta Lacks; HEPES: (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid); IgG: immunoglobulin G; K<sub>d</sub>: dissociation constant; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MCF7: Michigan cancer foundation-7; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MEM: minimum essential medium Eagle; MST: microscale thermophoresis; NEAA: non-essential amino acids; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; RAB: RAS-associated binding; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1 inducible coiled-coil protein 1; RBP: RAB-binding protein; SD: standard deviation; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBS-T: tris-buffered saline-tween 20; WD (repeat): tryptophan-aspartic acid (repeat); WIPI2B: WD repeat domain phosphoinositide interacting 2B; WT: wild type.",x-ray diffraction,2.4,1,4,A,92.5925925925926%,35.35911602209944%,1555,265,7,7,"['EDO', 'MG', 'PEG', 'GDP', 'PO4']","PO4, PEG, EDO, MG, GDP","PHOSPHATE ION, DI(HYDROXYETHYL)ETHER, 1,2-ETHANEDIOL, MAGNESIUM ION, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE",inactive,83,7,13,5,10,10,9,4,11,11,12,13,6,8,8,10,12,7,13,4,2

We have previously reported stapled peptides, based on the Ral effector RLIP76, that can disrupt Ral signaling. Stapled peptides are short peptides that are locked into their bioactive form using a synthetic brace. Here, using an affinity maturation of the RLIP76 Ral-binding domain, we identified several sequence substitutions that together improve binding to Ral proteins by more than 20-fold. Hits from the selection were rigorously analyzed to determine the contributions of individual residues and two 1.5 Å cocrystal structures of the tightest-binding mutants in complex with RalB revealed key interactions. Insights gained from this maturation were used to design second-generation stapled peptides based on RLIP76 that exhibited vastly improved selectivity for Ral GTPases when compared with the first-generation lead peptide. The binding of second-generation peptides to Ral proteins was quantified and the binding site of the lead peptide on RalB was determined by NMR.

It also links endosomes to the actin cytoskeleton. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of activation of EHBP1 actin-binding activity is unclear. Here, we show that both termini of EHBP1 have membrane targeting potential. EHBP1 associates with PI(3)P, PI(5)P, and phosphatidylserine via its N-terminal C2 domain. We show that in the absence of Rab8 family members, the C-terminal bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab binding (bMERB) domain forms an intramolecular complex with its central calponin homology (CH) domain and auto-inhibits actin binding. Rab8 binding to the bMERB domain relieves this inhibition. We have analyzed the CH:bMERB auto-inhibited complex and the active bMERB:Rab8 complex biochemically and structurally.

These secreted effectors modulate the functions of host cells and activate specific signalling cascades that result in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intestinal inflammation. Some of the Salmonella-encoded effectors counteract this inflammatory response and help to preserve host homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that the Salmonella effector protein SopD, which is required for pathogenesis, functions to both activate and inhibit the inflammatory response by targeting the Rab8 GTPase, which is a negative regulator of inflammation. We show that SopD has GTPase-activating protein activity for Rab8 and, therefore, inhibits this GTPase and stimulates inflammation. We also show that SopD activates Rab8 by displacing it from its cognate guanosine dissociation inhibitor, resulting in the stimulation of a signalling cascade that suppresses inflammation. We solved the crystal structure of SopD in association with Rab8 to a resolution of 2.3 Å, which reveals a unique contact interface that underlies these complex interactions.

Although several canonical downstream effectors have been extensively studied and tested as potential targets for RAS-driven cancers, many of these remain poorly characterized. In this study, we undertook a biochemical and structural approach to further study the role of Sin1 as a RAS effector. Sin1 interacted predominantly with KRAS isoform 4A in cells through an atypical RAS-binding domain that we have characterized by X-ray crystallography. Despite the essential role of Sin1 in the assembly and activity of mTORC2, we find that the interaction with RAS is not required for these functions.

7OGD,GTPase HRAS mutant D33K under ambient pressure,,Homo sapiens,9606,"In this work, we experimentally investigate the allosteric transitions between conformational states on the Ras oncogene protein using high pressure crystallography. Ras protein is a small GTPase involved in central regulatory processes occurring in multiple conformational states. Ras acts as a molecular switch between active GTP-bound, and inactive GDP-bound states, controlling essential signal transduction pathways. An allosteric network of interactions between the effector binding regions and the membrane interacting regions is involved in Ras cycling. The conformational states which coexist simultaneously in solution possess higher Gibbs free energy than the ground state. Equilibria between these states can be shifted by applying pressure favouring conformations with lower partial molar volume, and has been previously analyzed by high-pressure NMR spectroscopy. High-pressure macromolecular crystallography (HPMX) is a powerful tool perfectly complementary to high-pressure NMR, allowing characterization at the molecular level with a high resolution the different allosteric states involved in the Ras cycling. We observe a transition above 300 MPa in the crystal leading to more stable conformers. Thus, we compare the crystallographic structures of Ras(wt)·Mg<sup>2+</sup>·GppNHp and Ras(D33K)·Mg<sup>2+</sup>·GppNHp at various high hydrostatic pressures. This gives insight into per-residue descriptions of the structural plasticity involved in allosteric equilibria between conformers.

Solution data indicated that KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in complex with RGL1-RA both exist predominantly as 1:1 dimers, while tetramerization occurs through very slow association. Through detailed structural analyses, the distance and angle between RAS α1 helix and RBD/RA α1 helix were found to differ significantly among RAS and RBD/RA complexes. The KRAS/RGL1-RA structures possess some of the largest α1<sup>RAS</sup>/α1<sup>Effector</sup> distances (21.7-22.2 Å), whereas the corresponding distances in previously reported RAS/RAF complexes are significantly shorter (15.2-17.7 Å). Contact map analysis identified unique structural signatures involving contacts between the β1-β2 loop of RA and the α1 helix of RAS, clearly distinguishing the KRAS/RGL1-RA (and other RAS/RA complexes) from RAS/RBD complexes. These results demonstrate that RAS effectors employ an assortment of finely-tuned docking surfaces to achieve optimal interactions with RAS.",x-ray diffraction,1.96,1,2,A,89.41798941798942%,92.81437125748504%,2780,266,3,3,"['MG', 'PO4', 'GSP']","MG, GSP, PO4","MAGNESIUM ION, 5'-GUANOSINE-DIPHOSPHATE-MONOTHIOPHOSPHATE, PHOSPHATE ION",inactive,94,10,9,4,9,12,13,8,12,11,16,11,9,4,4,6,15,4,10,2,

7T47,KRAS G12D (GppCp) with MRTX-1133,,Homo sapiens,9606,"The ability to effectively target mutated KRAS has remained elusive despite decades of research. The recent identification of KRASG12C inhibitors has provided an effective treatment option for patients harboring this particular mutation and has also provided insight toward targeting other KRAS mutants, including KRASG12D. MRTX1133 was identified via a structure-based drug design (SBDD) strategy as a potent, selective, and non-covalent KRASG12D inhibitor directed at the switch II binding pocket. MRTX1133 demonstrated a high-affinity interaction with KRASG12D with KD or IC50 values each determined at ~0.2 pM or <2 nM using SPR direct binding or HTRF competition assays, respectively. MRTX1133 also demonstrated ~700-fold selectivity for KRASG12D vs KRASWT binding utilizing SPR. Interestingly, MRTX1133 demonstrated potent inhibition of active KRASG12D using an HTRF effector interaction assay with a IC50 value of 9 nM. Insight toward the structural basis of binding of MRTX1133 to both the inactive GDP-bound and active GMPPCP-bound conformations of KRASG12D is also provided by co-crystal structures. MRTX1133 demonstrated potent inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell viability in KRASG12D-mutant cell lines with median IC50 values of ~5 nM. Consistent with binding affinity determination in cell-free systems, MRTX1133 demonstrated >1000-fold selectivity for inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in KRASG12D-mutant cell lines compared with KRASWT cell lines. Dose-dependent inhibition of KRAS-mediated signal transduction was also observed in multiple KRASG12D-mutant tumor models in vivo. MRTX1133 demonstrated marked tumor regression (>30%) in a subset of KRASG12D-mutant cell line- and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, including 8 out of 11 (73%) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models evaluated. Pharmacological studies and CRISPR-based screens demonstrated co-targeting KRASG12D in concert with putative feedback or bypass pathways including EGFR and PI3Kα led to enhanced anti-tumor activity relative to targeting each individual protein. Together, these data indicate the feasibility of utilizing SBDD approaches to selectively target alternative KRAS mutant variants with non-covalent, high-affinity small molecules targeting either the active or inactive state of KRAS. In addition, these data illustrate the therapeutic susceptibility and broad dependence of KRASG12D mutation-positive tumors, including PDAC, on KRAS for tumor cell growth and survival.",x-ray diffraction,1.27,1,1,A,89.41798941798942%,91.61676646706587%,1699,407,6,6,"['ACT', '6IC', 'MG', 'GOL', 'GDP', 'GCP']","6IC, GCP, GDP, GOL, ACT, MG","4-(4-[(1R,5S)-3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-yl]-8-fluoro-2-{[(2R,4R,7aS)-2-fluorotetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizin-7a(5H)-yl]methoxy}pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)-5-ethynyl-6-fluoronaphthalen-2-ol, PHOSPHOMETHYLPHOSPHONIC ACID GUANYLATE ESTER, GUANOSINE-5'-DIPHOSPHATE, GLYCEROL, ACETATE ION, MAGNESIUM ION",inactive,232,10,9,4,10,12,13,8,12,12,15,11,9,4,4,6,16,4,10,,

7TVF,Crystal structure of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1CA (SMP) complex to a resolution of 2.17 Angstrom,,Homo sapiens,9606,"SHOC2 acts as a strong synthetic lethal interactor with MEK inhibitors in multiple KRAS cancer cell lines. SHOC2 forms a heterotrimeric complex with MRAS and PP1C that is essential for regulating RAF and MAPK-pathway activation by dephosphorylating a specific phosphoserine on RAF kinases. Here we present the high-resolution crystal structure of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C (SMP) complex and apo-SHOC2. Our structures reveal that SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1C form a stable ternary complex in which all three proteins synergistically interact with each other. Our results show that dephosphorylation of RAF substrates by PP1C is enhanced upon interacting with SHOC2 and MRAS. The SMP complex forms only when MRAS is in an active state and is dependent on SHOC2 functioning as a scaffolding protein in the complex by bringing PP1C and MRAS together.

However, our mechanistic understanding of how RAS signals through RAF is still incomplete. Although studies revealed snapshots for autoinhibited and active RAF-MEK1-14-3-3 complexes<sup>4</sup>, the intermediate steps that lead to RAF activation remain unclear. The MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C holophosphatase dephosphorylates RAF at serine 259, resulting in the partial displacement of 14-3-3 and RAF-RAS association<sup>3,5,6</sup>. MRAS, SHOC2 and PP1C are mutated in rasopathies-developmental syndromes caused by aberrant MAPK pathway activation<sup>6-14</sup>-and SHOC2 itself has emerged as potential target in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS-driven tumours<sup>15-18</sup>. Despite its importance, structural understanding of the SHOC2 holophosphatase is lacking. Here we determine, using X-ray crystallography, the structure of the MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C complex. SHOC2 bridges PP1C and MRAS through its concave surface and enables reciprocal interactions between all three subunits. Biophysical characterization indicates a cooperative assembly driven by the MRAS GTP-bound active state, an observation that is extendible to other RAS isoforms. Our findings support the concept of a RAS-driven and multi-molecular model for RAF activation in which individual RAS-GTP molecules recruit RAF-14-3-3 and SHOC2-PP1C to produce downstream pathway activation. Importantly, we find that rasopathy and cancer mutations reside at protein-protein interfaces within the holophosphatase, resulting in enhanced affinities and function.

As key virulence factors of C. difficile, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) act by glucosylating and inactivating Rho and Ras family small GTPases in host cells, which leads to actin cytoskeleton disruption, cell rounding, and ultimately cell death. Here we present the co-crystal structure of the glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) of TcdA in complex with its substrate human RhoA at 2.60-angstrom resolution. This structure reveals that TcdA GTD grips RhoA mainly through its switch I and switch II regions, which is complemented by interactions involving RhoA's pre-switch I region. Comprehensive structural comparisons between the TcdA GTD-RhoA complex and the structures of TcdB GTD in complex with Cdc42 and R-Ras reveal both the conserved and divergent features of these two toxins in terms of substrate recognition.

SHOC2 forms a ternary complex with MRAS and PP1C, and human germline gain-of-function mutations in this complex result in congenital RASopathy syndromes<sup>2-5</sup>. However, the structure and assembly of this complex are poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex. We define the biophysical principles of holoenzyme interactions, elucidate the assembly order of the complex, and systematically interrogate the functional consequence of nearly all of the possible missense variants of SHOC2 through deep mutational scanning. We show that SHOC2 binds PP1C and MRAS through the concave surface of the leucine-rich repeat region and further engages PP1C through the N-terminal disordered region that contains a cryptic RVXF motif. Complex formation is initially mediated by interactions between SHOC2 and PP1C and is stabilized by the binding of GTP-loaded MRAS. These observations explain how mutant versions of SHOC2 in RASopathies and cancer stabilize the interactions of complex members to enhance holophosphatase activity.

Recent progress in the development of covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> has revealed that occupancy of an allosteric binding site located between the α3-helix and switch-II loop of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-sometimes referred to as the 'switch-II pocket'-holds great potential in the design of direct inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>. In studying diverse switch-II pocket binders during the development of sotorasib (AMG 510), the first FDA-approved inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, we found the dramatic conformational flexibility of the switch-II pocket posing significant challenges toward the structure-based design of inhibitors. Here, we present our computational approaches for dealing with receptor flexibility in the prediction of ligand binding pose and binding affinity. For binding pose prediction, we modified the covalent docking program CovDock to allow for protein conformational mobility. This new docking approach, termed as FlexCovDock, improves success rates from 55 to 89% for binding pose prediction on a dataset of 10 cross-docking cases and has been prospectively validated across diverse ligand chemotypes. For binding affinity prediction, we found standard free energy perturbation (FEP) methods could not adequately handle the significant conformational change of the switch-II loop. We developed a new computational strategy to accelerate conformational transitions through the use of targeted protein mutations.

In this study, we solved the Rab6B structure in complex with the Rab6-binding domain of ELKS1, revealing that a C-terminal segment of ELKS1 forms a helical hairpin to recognize Rab6B through a unique binding mode. We further showed that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of ELKS1 allows it to compete with other Rab6 effectors for binding to Rab6B and accumulate Rab6B-coated liposomes to the protein condensate formed by ELKS1. We also found that the ELKS1 condensate recruits Rab6B-coated vesicles to vesicle-releasing sites and promotes vesicle exocytosis. Together, our structural, biochemical, and cellular analyses suggest that ELKS1, via the LLPS-enhanced interaction with Rab6, captures Rab6-coated vesicles from the cargo transport machine for efficient vesicle release at exocytotic sites.
